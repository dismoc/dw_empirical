3.Abstract: The federal funds rate is constructed as a volume-weighted average and masks
significant heterogeneity in individual federal funds transactions. This paper explores
one source of that heterogeneity: discount window access. Data from transaction-level
discount window borrowing and quarter call reports from 2010 to 2020 show clear
differences between banks with and without access to discount window lending. On
average, banks that can access the discount window hold fewer reserves, lend less on
the federal funds market, and borrow at a lower federal funds rate. This paper develops
a search theoretical framework to explain the observed heterogeneity taking discount
window access as exogenous. In the model, the discount window insures banks against
matching failures in the interbank market and provides an outside option that limits
the rents that lender banks can capture. The outside option role shows up as a lower
interest rate in the federal funds market, and the insurance role explains lower reserve
holdings and lower lending volume as a result
